# Cloud-Developer-Dashboard
All developer information directly on the dashboard

This is a simple project that lets you see all important Umbraco Cloud project information on the dashboard.
This is build without support of HQ so if they change anything that my code uses this will probably create a mess.
If that happens disable this and let me know and I'll see if it's possible to fix it.

For now it show:
- Baseline name
- Environments
- Environment versions
- Usage statistics
